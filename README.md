Mod 1 Code Challenge Review Assignment:

* Come up with a many to many relationship of your choosing
* Draw your model relationships
* In your lib folder build out a file for each model in your table
    * Build out your class for each model in its corresponding file
    * Build all the methods for the associations between the models (Example: if your domain was Doctors, Patients, and Appointments, there are 6 association methods doctor.appointments, doctor.patients, appointment.doctor, appointment.patient, patient.appointments, patient.doctors)
    * Set up a console file for quickly seeding and testing
    * After the associations are complete and you have tested that they work, get creative! Give yourself a challenge. Think of _questions you can ask of the data_. ie Who is the doctor who has seen the most patients?
        * Don't just use accessors for all attributes
        * Utilize some default values (don't just initialize with all values passed in as arguments)
        * Manipulate instances with instance methods
        * Write some class methods
        * Use your helper methods!
â€¢ When you are finished, build another!!!
